This is a command-line Python tool that analyzes synthetic FAB financial statements using an intelligent, LLM-style agent.
It supports natural-language questions, multi-step reasoning, financial calculations, scenario analysis, and automatic chart generation.

Features

1. Profitability calculations
    1.1 Net Profit
    1.2 ROE (Return on Equity) - ROE = Net Profit / Total Equity
    1.3 ROA (Return on Assets) - ROA = Net Profit / Total Assets
    1.4 Profit margin (from DuPont) - Profit Margin = Net Profit / Operating Income
    1.5 Asset turnover (from DuPont) - Asset Turnover = Operating Income / Total Assets
    1.6 Equity Multiplier (Financial Leverage) - Equity Multiplier = Total Assets / Total Equity
    1.7 ROE (DuPont Decomposition) - ROE = Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier

2. Efficiency & Income Calculations
    2.1 CIR (Cost-to-Income Ratio) - CIR = Operating Expenses / Operating Income
    2.2 NIM (Net Interest Margin) - NIM = Net Interest Income / Earning Assets
    2.3 CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) - CAGR = (Ending / Beginning)^(1/n) - 1

3. Credit Quality Calculations
    3.1 NPL Ratio - NPL Ratio = NPL / Total Loans
    3.2 ECL Ratio - ECL Ratio = ECL / Total Loans
    3.3 ECL Shock Scenario - [Shocked ECL = ECL * (1 + pct/100)
                            New Net Profit = Old NP - (Shocked ECL - Base ECL)
                            New ROE = New NP / Equity
                            Base ROE = Original NP / Equity]
    
4. Capital Adequacy Calculations
    4.1 CAR (Capital Adequacy Ratio) - CAR = Total Capital / RWA
    4.2 CET1 Ratio - CET1 Ratio = CET1 / RWA

5. Liquidity Calculations
    5.1 LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) - LCR = HQLA / Net Outflows
    5.2 NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio) - NSFR = ASF / RSF
    
6. Loan & Deposit Analytics
    6.1 LDR (Loan-to-Deposit Ratio) - LDR = Customer Loans / Customer Deposits

7. Scenario Simulations
    7.1 Opex Stress Test

8. Forecasting
    8.1 Linear Regression ROE Forecast

9. Peer Bank Analytics
10. Dashboard Aggregation



Usage:

Run the agent from the terminal by passing a question as a string.
